I am a Postdoctoral Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) at [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu). My research interests include stochastic control, mean field games, and financial mathematics.

Before that, I got my Ph.D. in the [Department of Mathematical sciences](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences) at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu) in May 2024, under the supervision of Prof. [Qingshuo Song](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/qsong).

I also hold a master's degree in Mathematical Finance and Statistics from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/ma/) (July 2019) and bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, and Financial Management from [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn) (June 2018).
