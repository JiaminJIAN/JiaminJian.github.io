I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Mathematical sciences](https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/mathematical-sciences) at [WPI](https://www.wpi.edu). My research interest includes stochastic control and mean field games. At WPI, my advisor is Prof. [Qingshuo Song](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/qsong).

I got my Master's degree from the City University of Hong Kong in 2019 and my Bachelor's degree from Nankai University in 2018.
